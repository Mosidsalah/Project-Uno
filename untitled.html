<p style='color:white'> A famous quote by Sident: </p>
<blockquote style='color:greenyellow' cite='https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/01/artificial-intelligence-revolution-1.html'> When the darkest of nights, meets the brightest of lights, what happens can only be described using intuition, experience, and a solid pair of polaroids because wtf just happened - Siddhant Agarwal </blockquote>
<h1 style='color:lime'><u> About me</u> </h1>
<p style='color:mediumvioletred'> My name is Sident the Sidentation, aka Sid Agarwal. I just graduated from B.I.S and I'm going to UC Berkeley to start off my college journey. This website is an attempt to quell the boredom of quarantine while learning a few new skills. </p>

<h3 style='color:yellow'><u> Some things I enjoy doing:</u> </h3>
<p1 style='color:green'><b><i> EXERCISING</i> </b> : one of the things I enjoy doing is going to the gym really frequently and playing football, casual and competitive. Working out makes me feel great, and even if the gym is shut I always find a way to workout, just as I am doing right now during this crazy time of Lady Corona. </p1> </br>

<a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4dPd708Sk98'> Here's the link to the above reference </a> </br>
<p style='color:orange'> <b> <i>GUITAR </i> </b> : I enjoy playing the guitar and recording music, and I play for a band called 'No Feedback'. In my free time when I have nothing to do i often pick up my guitar and mess around with it, playing random chords and strumming random patterns to see what sounds good. <a href='https://www.youtube.com/'> Youtube </a> is a great place to learn new songs. </p>
<p style='color:turquoise'><b> <i> EATING</i> </b> : Here's a list of some of my favourite foods: </p> 
<ul style='color:darkblue'>
	<li>Sushi</li>
	<li>Chocolate</li>
	<li>Chips</li>
</ul>
<p style='color:purple'><b><i> DOGS </i></b> : I really love animals, and I have always wished my parents allowed me to get a dog. I volunteered at W.S.D because i really wanted to help out and make sure the dogs there are at the receving end of care and love. It was one of the most fulfilling experiences of my life, and as soon as quarantine ends I would love to start going to W.S.D again. </p>
